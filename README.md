# My-Weather-App-Site
weather app website that displays real-time weather information using a public API.
This project demonstrates the skills I've developed in working with APIs, fetching data asynchronously, and dynamically displaying weather information. The application utilizes the WeatherAPI to fetch real-time weather data based on the user's location or a default city and displays it in a user-friendly interface.
